OOP Task1: Bank Account Class

A dart project that contains a bank account class:
The bank account class has two fields(accountId and balance), and three methods (deposit, withdraw,
displayAccountInfo).
Also includes two constructors(one for the accountId and the other is named constructor for
balance).

Code explanation:
First, i created the bank account class with all of its data. Then i created two objects from the
bank account class in main.dart file.
The first account is created using the default constructor and the second account is created using
the named constructor.
The scenario is tested by creating an account and depositing money, then withdraw money, and then
printing the account information.

The first scenario is creating `bankAccount` object and depositing amount of 1000, then withdraw
500,
and finally printing the account information.

The second scenario is withdrawing (-500) from 'bankAccount', and then printing the
account information includes an error message if exists.

The third scenario is creating `bankAccount2` object and depositing amount of 2000, then withdraw
3000, and finally printing the
account information includes an error message if exists.

My code in bin/main.dart,   
Bank account class in bin/bank_account_class.dart
