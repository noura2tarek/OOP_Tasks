OOP Task1: Bank Account Class:   

A dart project that contains a bank account class:
The bank account class has two fields(accountId and balance), and three methods (deposit, withdraw,
displayAccountInfo).
Also includes two constructors(one for the accountId only and the other is named constructor for
balance and accountId).

Code explanation:
1- First, i created the bank account class with all of its data. 
2- Then i created two objects from the bank account class in main.dart file.
3- The first account is created using the named constructor with accountId 001 and initialize balance to zero
and the second account is created using the default constructor with account id of 002 and balance of 2000.
4- The scenario is tested by creating an account and depositing money, then withdraw money, and then
printing the account information.

The first scenario using `bankAccount` object and depositing amount of 1000, then withdraw
500,
and finally printing the account information.

The second scenario is withdrawing (-500) from 'bankAccount', and then printing the
account information includes an error message if exists.

The third scenario using `bankAccount2` object and depositing amount of 1000, then withdraw
4000, and finally printing the
account information includes an error message if exists.
