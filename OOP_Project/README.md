OOP Project: Library system task   

A dart project that contains three classes: Book class, user class, and Library class.
The Book Class has attributes (id, title, borrowed), and displayInfo method.
The User Class has attributes (id, name), and displayInfo method.
The Library Class has attributes (list of books , list of users), and methods (addBook , return
book, borrowBook, displayInfo).

Code explanation:
1- First, i created the book and user classes. 
2- Then i created the library class with help of them.
3- The scenario is tested by adding books and users to the library, then borrowing a book and return
back using these users,
and finally printing the library information.

My code in bin/main.dart,   
Classes in bin/classes folder,
